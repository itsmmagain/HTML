        <h3>NOTABLE EVENTS:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                Professor Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,<small> Order of Merlin, First Class, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards</small> was born in late August 1881  in the mainly wizarding village of Mould-on-the-Wold.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                He was the son of Percival and Kendra Dumbledore, and the elder brother of Aberforth and Ariana. His father died in Azkaban when Albus was young, while his mother and sister were later accidentally killed. His early losses greatly affected him early on, even at his death many years later, but, in turn, made him a better person.

            <li>
                <p>
                A Muggle-supporting wizard, though the complete opposite in his earlier years, he was considered to have been the greatest wizard of modern times, perhaps of all time.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Dumbledore became most famous for defeating Grindelwald in arguably the most epic duel of all time.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    He also gained much more recognition with his involvement in the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood and his work on alchemy with Nicolas Flamel.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    He founded and led the Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War. Following Voldemort's return and the start of the Second Wizarding War after the resignation of Cornelius Fudge, Dumbledore swiftly formed and led the second Order of the Phoenix. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Dumbledore became the only wizard that Voldemort ever feared. He was the wielder and the master of the Elder Wand from 1945 until 1997, and considered by many as the greatest Hogwarts Headmaster.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Though he was no longer alive at the time, it was through Dumbledore's manipulations that Voldemort was ultimately defeated, and lasting peace finally restored to the wizarding world.
                </p>

                    Dumbledore is the only Headmaster who was laid to rest at Hogwarts. A portrait of him still remains at Hogwarts. Harry Potter later named his second son, Albus Severus Potter, after him.

                    <strong>Dumbledore:</strong> "I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and temptation. I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher." <br> <strong>Harry Potter:</strong> "You were the best." <br> — A discussion in limbo regarding power and leadership

                    He died on 30 June, 1997 (aged 115) on the Astronomy Tower, Hogwarts Castle, Highlands, Scotland, Great Britain.

                <i>
                    "Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him."
— Albus Dumbledore's obituary by Elphias Doge
